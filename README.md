# Udemy-Challenge-8---Dictionaries

The aim of this challenge was the following:

# Modify the program so that the exits is a dictionary rather than a list,
# with the keys being the numbers of the locations and the values being
# dictionaries holding the exits (as they do at present). No change should
# be needed to the actual code.
#
# Once that is working, create another dictionary that contains words that
# players may use. These words will be the keys, and their values will be
# a single letter that the program can use to determine which way to go.

The program I must modify is this:

locations = {0: "You are sitting in front of a computer learning Python",
             1: "You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building",
             2: "You are at the top of a hill",
             3: "You are inside a building, a well house for a small stream",
             4: "You are in a valley beside a stream",
             5: "You are in the forest"}

exits = [{"Q": 0},
         {"W": 2, "E": 3, "N": 5, "S": 4, "Q": 0},
         {"N": 5, "Q": 0},
         {"W": 1, "Q": 0},
         {"N": 1, "W": 2, "Q": 0},
         {"W": 2, "S": 1, "Q": 0}]

loc = 1
while True:
    availableExits = ", ".join(exits[loc].keys())

    print(locations[loc])

    if loc == 0:
        break

    print("Available exits are: " + availableExits)
    direction = input("Please enter a direction: ").upper()
    print()
    if direction in exits[loc]:
        loc = exits[loc][direction]
    else:
        print("You cannot go in that direction")
